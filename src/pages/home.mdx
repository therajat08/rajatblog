# Hey people ðŸ‘‹
My name is Rajat, a final year grad student.

Welcome to my new home on the internet. You are on the home page.  

I have been trying to develop writing as a habit. Trying to maintain a balance between information consumption and production. 

My posts generally cover productivity, competitive programming, or any other technical stuff i am into.
