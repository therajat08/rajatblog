Following are some of the points covered and talked about in [ Lex Fridman's ](https://twitter.com/lexfridman) podcast with [ Manolis Kellis ](https://twitter.com/manoliskellis) 

* We are not the creator of first digital computer but descendant of one.
* Mendel role in digital inheritance.
* Key thing ancients didn't understand:
  * Continuum in inheritance features was not matching Mendel's theory.
* If people know about the human genome,there would be no wars.
  * Any two people about 99% similar.
* most species inherit vertically, we inherit horizontally; especially more with internet.
* A person from ancient Egypt brought today will grow up to be completely normal.
* neoteny
* Brain continues to develop in malleable way 
* Aspect of internet: doesn't matter who you are; ideas matter
* Teach a man  to fish for one day. He wont be hungry for rest of his life.
* Epistemology; the way to acquire knowledge.
* Very optimistic about the way knowledge spreads in today's world.
* So many nature papers are scrutinized
* We are the most studied species on the planet; wasn't the case earlier. Humans were verified last among others.
* How much free will do we have. How much of it is hard-coded. Our choices ?
* Do we live in simulation?
  * completely bs
* i use computer science to understand biology
* WE are now able to detect additional signals from the universe;like gravitational waves withe LIGO
* it might be best time as human being to be living and alive
* there is difference between what press picks and what is fundamentally advances
* Dinosaurs ruled earth for 175 millions years old. We have been here for less than a million year old. After them mammals evolved.
* We wouldn't be here if viruses weren't there. Viruses aren't dumb; they don't care. It just spreads.Over evolutionary time, viruses that spread well and don't kill the host will survive.
* We are hard-coded to make one protein from one RNA molecule. Coronavirus tricks our body to make 30 proteins from single RNA. Virus basically hijacks our cell , cuts human RNA, to tell ribosome don't look at them but its own RNAs
* Evolutionary selection is ruthless, brutal and comes with a lot of killing.
* We need diversity. If we had 100 million physicist living, we would be in trouble. Not worried for human species as we are so diverse against attacks like coronavirus
* The more you protect your immune system from exposure, less opportunity it has to prepare itself from future attacks.
* Diet and exercise are best way to boost every aspect of your health.
* we have more non human cells than human cells, giant bag of bacteria.
* Placebo- if i can trick your brain into thinking that i am healing you, the brain will figure out a way to heal itself and body.
* Difference between way human and computer store info?
  * the code / genes are itself digital. Human genome is first resilient and then anything else. In cs we hate messy code, but genome is messy.
* Mutation is the path to new things , but also path to break old things.

* What is the meaning of life?

  Life symposium
  A friend of Manolis:
  Pythian answer(cryptic open to interpretation)
    * become one, 3 interpretations:
    * like a child become one who likes to discovering about this world
    * whatever you do, drive yourself to be the one or for perfection
    * and become one when people are separate
